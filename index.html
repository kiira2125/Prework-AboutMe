      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm not a fan of pictures, lol, but here you go. 
        I like working out, PS4 and Xbox1 (destiny and COD3) PC (LOL). 
        I love learning a new language; my only issue is that those around me don't speak the languages I am learning, makes it hard to keep. 
        I studied Japanese here and lived in the summer in Japan, which was awesome. 
        I did not study Japanese because of animes lol, it was because my mom's best friend was Japanese (Okinawa born and grew up in Tokyo then the US). 
        She was like my second mom, who raised me in Japanese culture. 
        I learned to speak Japanese first before Castilian or English. 
        As I grew up, I lost the ability to speak Japanese. 
        I studied it during my college years and went to school for the summer.
        I had close friends there, so housing was awesome living with them. 
        I love C# programing took a few classes, but Fullerton does not offer much, so I was super sad. 
        I also wanted to take some python, but not too many classes offered for that language. 
        But, I know since I got into computers that I want to do programming. 
        I love cooking and trying out new stuff, and I love outdoor sports; they are the best. 
        I am in love with J/K/C/TH/V foods all A-foods, O_o. 
        Basically, I try something new but no pork lol, because I am severely allergic to it due to the chemicals they use to process that meat.  
        My friend from Santa Cruz :smiling_face_with_3_hearts: ~_^</p>
